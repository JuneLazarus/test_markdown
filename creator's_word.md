This is a sample document for the purpose of demonstrating the use of Markdown language. It is written in a simple and easy-to-read format.
## Introduction

This document is intended to provide a sample of what a developer's word document might look like. It includes a brief introduction to Markdown, as well as some sample code and syntax examples.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read, write, and understand. It is a plain text formatting syntax that can be used to format documents, articles, and emails. It is supported by many applications, including GitHub, StackOverflow, and WordPress.

## Syntax Examples

Here are some sample syntax examples:

### Headings

To create headings, use the hash symbol (#) followed by a space and the heading text. The number of hash symbols indicates the level of the heading.

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

### Bold and Italic Text

To make text bold or italic, use the asterisk (*) or underscore (_) before and after the text.

```
This is *bold* text.

This is _italic_ text.
```

### Lists

To create a list, use the hyphen (-) or asterisk (*) followed by a space before each item in the list.

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

### Links

To create a link, use the following syntax:

```
[Link Text](https://example.com)
```

### Images

To insert an image, use the following syntax:

```
![Image Alt Text](image_url)
```

### Code Blocks

To create a code block, use the backtick (`) before and after the code.

```
```
This is a code block.
```
```

### Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, use the greater than (>) symbol before the text.

```
> This is a blockquote.
```

### Horizontal Rule

To create a horizontal rule, use three asterisks (*) or underscores (_) on a line by themselves.

```
